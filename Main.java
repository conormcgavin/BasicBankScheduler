/* --Notes about this model--
 * Credit system works and over time people will receive the same score and the same number of preferences
 * However during an arbritary week there is no balance
 * If 2 people ask for exactly the same preferences then the system will give all 3 to the same person with the highest bank
 * There is fairness in the long term, but on a short basis this is not good and employees may struggle to understand why someone is getting 3 preferences and they are getting none
 * 
 * If someone asks for the same thing every single week, and is the only one to ask, they will always get it, but there bank will eventually hit 0 if everyone else is getting less than them.
